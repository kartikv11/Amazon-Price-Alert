Poll an Amazon sale page (or multiple pages) for a maximum price and send yourself an email if the price check passes.

The script was tested on Amazon, so if you try running it on a different site make sure the XPATH_SELECTOR is set correctly and that the price check itself is correct.
The smtp client is configured for Gmail, so be sure to change it if you're using a different one.

Don't forget entering your credentials inside the 'creds' config file.
